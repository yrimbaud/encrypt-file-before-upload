# Encrypt file(s) before upload

This repository hosts a solution for encrypting files in the browser before uploading them to a server.

## Overview

In an era where data security and privacy are paramount, it's crucial to ensure that your files are secure before transmitting them over the internet. This project provides a solution for encrypting files directly within the browser before they are uploaded to a server.

The main advantage of this approach is that it offers an additional layer of security. If the server is ever compromised, the encrypted files remain protected, as the encryption keys are not stored on the server.

## Features

- Client-side file encryption before upload
- Enhances data privacy and security
- Minimizes the risk of data breaches

## Usage

Please refer to the code files for specific usage details. The solution can be incorporated into your projects to secure file uploads.

## Disclaimer

Please note that while this method enhances security, it does not guarantee complete protection against all types of cyber threats. Always follow best practices for security, and use this as part of a multi-layered security strategy.
